# Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch
Welcome to [__Practical Deep Learning for Coders__](https://course.fast.ai/). This web site covers the book and the 2020 version of the course, which are designed to work closely together. If you haven't yet got the book, you can buy it here. It's also freely available as interactive Jupyter Notebooks; read on to learn how to access them.
