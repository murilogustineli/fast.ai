    "1. Do you need these for deep learning?\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Lots of data T / F - __*False*__\n",
    "   - Lots of expensive computers T / F - __*False*__\n",
    "   - A PhD T / F - __*False*__\n",
    "  \n",
    "> Don't need lots of math, don't need lots of data, don't need expensive computers, definitely don't need a PhD.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Name five areas where deep learning is now the best in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Computer vision, biology, robotics, finance, natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What was the name of the first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Mark I Perceptron built by Frank Rosenblatt.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Based on the book of the same name, what are the requirements for parallel distributed processing (PDP)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. A set of __*processing units*__\n",
    "> 2. A __*state of activation*__\n",
    "> 3. An __*output function*__ for each unit\n",
    "> 4. A __*pattern of connectivity*__ among units\n",
    "> 5. A __*propagation rule*__ for patterns of activities through the network of connectivities\n",
    "> 6. An __*activation rule*__ for combining the inputs impinging on a unit with the current state of that unit to produce an output for the unit\n",
    "> 7. A __*learning rule*__ whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by experience\n",
    "> 8. An __*environment*__ within which the system must operate\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What were the two theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neural networks?\n",
    "\n",
    "> In 1969, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert wrote the book \"Perceptrons\" which showed that a single layer of artificial neurons was unable to learn mathematical functions, like the XOR logic gate. While they subsequently demonstrated in the same book that additional layers can solve this problem, only the first insight was recognized, leading to the start of the first AI winter.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> In the 1980’s, models with two layers were being explored. Theoretically, it is possible to approximate any mathematical function using two layers of artificial neurons. However, in practice, these networks were too big and too slow. While it was demonstrated that adding additional layers improved performance, this insight was not acknowledged, and the second AI winter began. In this past decade, with increased data availability, and improvements in computer hardware (both in CPU performance but more importantly in GPU performance), neural networks are finally living up to its potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is a GPU?\n",
    "\n",
    "> GPU stands for Graphics Processing Unit (also known as a graphics card) and it's responsible for making a lot of computations. CPUs, or central processing units, are the core units of all standard computers, and they execute the instructions that make up computer programs. GPUs, on the other hand, are specialized units meant for displaying graphics, especially the 3D graphics in modern computer games. The hardware optimizations used in GPUs allow it to handle thousands of tasks at the same time. Incidentally, these optimizations allow us to run and train neural networks hundreds of times faster than a regular CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Open a notebook and execute a cell containing: `1+1`. What happens?\n",
    "\n",
    "> In a Jupyter Notebook, we can create code cells and run code in an interactive manner. When we execute a cell containing some code (in this case: 1+1), the code is run by Python and the output is displayed underneath the code cell (in this case: 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Follow through each cell of the stripped version of the notebook for this chapter. Before executing each cell, guess what will happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To be done by the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Complete the Jupyter Notebook online appendix.\n",
    "\n",
    "> To be done by the reader.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Why is it hard to use a traditional computer program to recognize images in a photo?\n",
    "\n",
    "> For us humans, it is easy to identify different objects in photos, or to identify the main label of a photo, such as identifying cats vs dogs in a photo. This is because, subconciously, our brains have learned the underlying patterns and features that define a cat or a dog for example. However, it's hard to imagine how we could define such rules for a computer program to recognize a cat or a dog. How would you program that? Can you think of a universal rule to determine if a photo contains a cat or dog? This is very difficult because cats, dogs, and other objects, have a wide variety of shapes, textures, colors, and other features. It's close to impossible to manually program this in a way that a computer would be able to recognize those patterns.\n",

    "11. What did Samuel mean by \"weight assignment\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "> In 1949, Arthur Samuel, an IBM researcher started working on a different way to get computers to complete tasks, which he called \"machine learning\". In 1962, he published the classic essay \"Artificial Intelligence: A Frontier of Automation\" where the basic idea was instead of telling the computer the exact steps required to solve a problem, show it examples of problems to solve, and let it figure it out how to solve it itself. This turned out to be very effective, and in 1961, his checkers-playing program beat the Connecticut state champion, the first time a computer beat a human-being in a game of intelligence.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> His idea to build intelligent computers involves __*weight assignments*__. Weights are just variables, and a weight assignment is choosing values for those variables. Those weights assignments (values) are combined with inputs, which are other set of values (e.g., image pixels), and together they define how the program will operate. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">Arthur Samuel further mentions an __*\"automatic means of testing the effectiveness of any current weight assignment\"*__ and a __*\"mechanism for altering the weight assignment so as to maximize the performance\"*__. This refers to the evaluation and training of the model in order to obtain a set of parameter values that maximizes model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What term do we normally use in deep learning for what Samuel called \"weights\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "> In deep learning jargon, weights are referenced as _parameters_. The term _weights_ is reserved for a particular type of model parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Draw a picture that summarizes Samuel's view of a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "> <img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/deep-learning-for/9781492045519/assets/dlcf_0106.png\" width=700 height=700 />\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Why is it hard to understand why a deep learning model makes a particular prediction?\n",
    "\n",
    "> A neural network is a particular kind of deep learning models, which is a subset of machine learning. The adjective \"deep\" from deep learning refers to many layers in the network. Those networks can have hundreds of layers, where each neuron in one layer is affecting the connected neurons in subsequent layers. Altogether, due to the complex nature of deep learning models, it is very difficult to understand why a neural network makes a given prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. What is the name of the theorem that shows that a neural network can solve any mathematical problem to any level of accuracy?\n",
    "\n",
    "> __*Universal approximation theorem*__ is a mathematical proof that shows a neural network can solve any problem to any level of accuracy, in theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. What do you need in order to train a model?\n",
    "\n",
    "> You need data related to the task you want to solve, and an architecture chosen for that given task. For most use-cases of deep learning, you will need labels for your data to compare your model predictions to. You will need a loss function that will quantitatively measure the performance of your model. And you need a way to update the parameters of the model in order to improve its performance (this is known as an optimizer). \n",

    "18. Do we always have to use 224×224-pixel images with the cat recognition model?\n",

    "20. What is a validation set? What is a test set? Why do we need them?\n",
    "21. What will fastai do if you don't provide a validation set?\n",
    "22. Can we always use a random sample for a validation set? Why or why not?\n",
